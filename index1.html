    <!-- Polyfill -->
    <h2>Polyfill</h2>
    <p>• In web development, a polyfill is code that implements a feature on web browsers that 
        do not support the feature.</p>
    <p>• Most often, it refers to a JavaScript library that implements an HTML5 or CSS web standard, 
        either an established standard on older browsers, or a proposed standard on existing browsers.</p>
    <p>• In other words, it means if the current browser doesn't support the new method, i.e, call 
        or apply or bind than polyfill is used with these methods to get code worked in the old 
        browser.</p>

    <!-- Bind Method -->
    <h2>Bind Method</h2>
    <p>• With the bind() method, an object can borrow a method from another object.</p>
    <p>• Sometimes the bind() method has to be used to prevent loosing this. When a function is used 
        as a callback, this is lost.</p>
    <p>• The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the 
        provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function 
        is called.</p>
    <p>• Why do we use the bind method?
        We use the Bind() method to call a function with the this value, this keyword refers to the same 
        object which is currently selected . In other words, bind() method allows us to easily set which 
        object will be bound by the this keyword when a function or method is invoked.</p>

    <!-- Function Currying -->
    <h2>Function Currying</h2>
    <p>• In other terms, currying is when a function — instead of taking all arguments at one time — 
        takes the first one and returns a new function, which takes the second one and returns a new 
        function, which takes the third one, etc. until all arguments are completed.</p>

    <!-- Debouncing -->
    <h2>Debouncing</h2>
    <p>• Debouncing in JavaScript is a practice used to improve browser performance.</p>
    <p>• Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so
        often, that it stalls the performance of the web page.</p>
    <p>• In other words, it limits the rate at which a function gets invoked.</p>

    <h2>Debouncing via Button</h2>
    <button id = "debounce">CLICK HERE</button>

    <h2>Debouncing via Input type text</h2>
    <input type = "text" onkeyup = "betterFunction()">

    <!-- Event Delegation -->
    <h2>Event Delegation</h2>
    <p>• Event Delegation is basically a pattern to handle events efficiently.</p>
    <p>• Instead of adding an event listener to each and every similar element, we can add an event 
        listener to a parent element and call an event on a particular target using the .target property 
        of the event object.</p>
    <hr>

    <!-- Event Delegation via Unordered List -->
    <h2>Event Delegation via Unordered List</h2>
    <div>
        <ul id = "category">
            <li id = "laptops">laptops</li>
            <li id = "cameras">cameras</li>
            <li id = "shoes">shoes</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Event Delegation via Input type text -->
    <h2>Event Delegation via Input type text</h2>
    <div id = "form">
        First Name : <input type = "text" id = "firstName" data-uppercase><br><br>
        Last Name : <input type = "text" id = "lastName" data-uppercase><br><br>
        Gender : <input type = "text" id = "gender" data-uppercase>
    </div>

    <!-- Prototype and Prototypal Inheritance -->
    <h2>Prototype and Prototypal Inheritance</h2>
    <p>• When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects.</p>
    <p>• Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype. 
        That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null 
        as its prototype.</p>
    <p>• When we read a property from object , and it's missing, JavaScript automatically takes it from 
        the prototype</p>

    <!-- Throttling -->
    <h2>Throttling</h2>
    <p>• Throttling or sometimes is also called throttle function is a practice used in websites.</p>
    <p>• Throttling is used to call a function after every millisecond or a particular interval of 
        time only the first click is executed immediately.</p>
    <p>• It prevents frequent calling of the function.</p>
    <p>• It makes the website faster and controls the rate at which a particular function is called.</p>
    <hr>

    <!-- Throttling via Button -->
    <h2>Throttling via Button</h2>
    <button type = "button" id = "throttleBtn">CLICK ME</button>

    <!-- Higher Order Functions -->
    <h2>Higher Order Functions</h2>
    <p>• A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function.</p>
    <p>• Higher order function is in contrast to first order functions, which don't take a function as an 
        argument or return a function as output.</p>
    <hr>

    <!-- MAP Function -->
    <h2>MAP Function</h2>
    <p>• Map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.</p>
    <p>• Map() calls a function once for each element in an array. It does not execute the function for empty
        elements.</p>
    <p>• It does not change the original array.</p>
    <hr>

    <!-- FILTER Function -->
    <h2>FILTER Function</h2>
    <p>• Filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.</p>
    <p>• The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements.</p>
    <p>• It does not change the original array.</p>
    <hr>

    <!-- REDUCE Function -->
    <h2>REDUCE Function</h2>
    <p>• The reduce() method executes a reducer function for array element. The reduce() method returns a 
        single value: the function's accumulated result.</p>
    <p>• The reduce() method does not execute the function for empty array elements.</p>
    <p>• It does not change the original array.</p>
    <hr>

    <!-- setTimeout + Closures -->
    <h2>setTimeout + Closures</h2>
    <p>• A closure basically means that a function binds together with its lexical environment.</p>
    <hr>

    <!-- Callback Functions -->
    <h2>Callback Functions</h2>
    <p>• A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function. This technique allows 
        a function to call another function.</p>
    <p>• It can run after another function has finished.</p>
    <p>• It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from problems and 
        error.</p>
    <p>• In JavaScript, the way to create a callback function is to pass it as a parameter to 
        another function, and then to call it back right after something has happened or some 
        task is completed.</p>

    <!-- Trust Issues with setTimeout() -->
    <h2>Trust Issues with setTimeout()</h2>
    <p>• It does not guarantee you that it will exactly the time mentioned lets say, 5000ms
        (5 seconds) but on the other hand yes it does guarantee that it will wait exactly 
        5000ms and maybe anytime after that.</p>
