    <!-- Polyfill -->
    <h2>Polyfill</h2>
    <p>• In web development, a polyfill is code that implements a feature on web browsers that 
        do not support the feature.</p>
    <p>• Most often, it refers to a JavaScript library that implements an HTML5 or CSS web standard, 
        either an established standard on older browsers, or a proposed standard on existing browsers.</p>
    <p>• In other words, it means if the current browser doesn't support the new method, i.e, call 
        or apply or bind than polyfill is used with these methods to get code worked in the old 
        browser.</p>

    <!-- Function Currying -->
    <h2>Function Currying</h2>
    <p>• In other terms, currying is when a function — instead of taking all arguments at one time — 
        takes the first one and returns a new function, which takes the second one and returns a new 
        function, which takes the third one, etc. until all arguments are completed.</p>

    <!-- Debouncing -->
    <h2>Debouncing</h2>
    <p>• Debouncing in JavaScript is a practice used to improve browser performance.</p>
    <p>• Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so
        often, that it stalls the performance of the web page.</p>
    <p>• In other words, it limits the rate at which a function gets invoked.</p>

    <!-- Event Delegation -->
    <h2>Event Delegation</h2>
    <p>• Event Delegation is basically a pattern to handle events efficiently.</p>
    <p>• Instead of adding an event listener to each and every similar element, we can add an event 
        listener to a parent element and call an event on a particular target using the .target property 
        of the event object.</p>
