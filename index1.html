    <!-- Polyfill -->
    <h2>Polyfill</h2>
    <p>• In web development, a polyfill is code that implements a feature on web browsers that 
        do not support the feature.</p>
    <p>• Most often, it refers to a JavaScript library that implements an HTML5 or CSS web standard, 
        either an established standard on older browsers, or a proposed standard on existing browsers.</p>
    <p>• In other words, it means if the current browser doesn't support the new method, i.e, call 
        or apply or bind than polyfill is used with these methods to get code worked in the old 
        browser.</p>

    <!-- Bind Method -->
    <h2>Bind Method</h2>
    <p>• With the bind() method, an object can borrow a method from another object.</p>
    <p>• Sometimes the bind() method has to be used to prevent loosing this. When a function is used 
        as a callback, this is lost.</p>
    <p>• The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the 
        provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function 
        is called.</p>
    <p>• Why do we use the bind method?
        We use the Bind() method to call a function with the this value, this keyword refers to the same 
        object which is currently selected . In other words, bind() method allows us to easily set which 
        object will be bound by the this keyword when a function or method is invoked.</p>

    <!-- Function Currying -->
    <h2>Function Currying</h2>
    <p>• In other terms, currying is when a function — instead of taking all arguments at one time — 
        takes the first one and returns a new function, which takes the second one and returns a new 
        function, which takes the third one, etc. until all arguments are completed.</p>

    <!-- Debouncing -->
    <h2>Debouncing</h2>
    <p>• Debouncing in JavaScript is a practice used to improve browser performance.</p>
    <p>• Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so
        often, that it stalls the performance of the web page.</p>
    <p>• In other words, it limits the rate at which a function gets invoked.</p>

    <!-- Event Delegation -->
    <h2>Event Delegation</h2>
    <p>• Event Delegation is basically a pattern to handle events efficiently.</p>
    <p>• Instead of adding an event listener to each and every similar element, we can add an event 
        listener to a parent element and call an event on a particular target using the .target property 
        of the event object.</p>

    <!-- Event Delegation via Unordered List -->
    <h2>Event Delegation via Unordered List</h2>
    <div>
        <ul id = "category">
            <li id = "laptops">laptops</li>
            <li id = "cameras">cameras</li>
            <li id = "shoes">shoes</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Event Delegation via Input type text</h2>
    <div id = "form">
        First Name : <input type = "text" id = "firstName" data-uppercase><br><br>
        Last Name : <input type = "text" id = "lastName" data-uppercase><br><br>
        Gender : <input type = "text" id = "gender" data-uppercase>
    </div>

    <!-- Prototype and Prototypal Inheritance -->
    <h2>Prototype and Prototypal Inheritance</h2>
    <p>• When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects.</p>
    <p>• Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype. 
        That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null 
        as its prototype.</p>
    <p>• When we read a property from object , and it's missing, JavaScript automatically takes it from 
        the prototype</p>

    <!-- Throttling -->
    <h2>Throttling</h2>
    <p>• Throttling or sometimes is also called throttle function is a practice used in websites. Throttling 
        is used to call a function after every millisecond or a particular interval of time only the first 
        click is executed immediately.</p>
    <p>• It prevents frequent calling of the function.</p>
    <p>• It makes the website faster and controls the rate at which a particular function is called.</p>
