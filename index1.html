    <h2>Polyfill</h2>
    <p>• In web development, a polyfill is code that implements a feature on web browsers that 
        do not support the feature.</p>
    <p>• Most often, it refers to a JavaScript library that implements an HTML5 or CSS web standard, 
        either an established standard on older browsers, or a proposed standard on existing browsers.</p>
    <p>• In other words, it means if the current browser doesn't support the new method, i.e, call 
        or apply or bind than polyfill is used with these methods to get code worked in the old 
        browser.</p>
